Hi Kabuc0,

Recently you wrote on my github question, I assume you have made great progress in using yolov5 to detect objects from the Ip camera.

I would like to ask you if you could help me, because I am trying to make a simliar project.

I am a bit desperate to get this project done, I have been trying to do this for quite some time, but have not been able to achieve any encouraging results.
